    excerpt:
      'YoRHa Unit 7E reports on contact with abandoned resistance hardware beneath the dunes.',
    body: `Detected a buried transport beneath shifting dunes at 11:32 local. The chassis bears resistance insignia but its black box was **YoRHa-manufactured**.

Recovered memory shards reference a cancelled supply corridor to the Amusement Park. Routing fragments to the Bunker for deeper analysis.

Hypothesis: rogue supply lines continued after command signed the shutdown order. Requesting clearance to pursue surviving operators. Glory to mankind.`,

    title: 'Operator 6O Broadcast: Aurora Downlink',
    date: '11945-05-28',
    excerpt:
      'Signal interference report forwarded to all combat units rotating through the City Ruins.',
    body: `Hi! Operator 6O checking in. We've identified a shimmering aurora in the lower atmosphereâ€”think of it as natural satellite static. It's gorgeous, but it's also bending our comms like ribbons.

Please recalibrate your uplink arrays before dispatch. The distortion is strongest around collapsed overpasses where the resistance has set up their kiosks.

If you capture any scenic data, tag it and route it to me. I promise to compile a morale package once the disturbance settles.`,
