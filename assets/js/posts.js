Sentimental Value - ok

Marty Supreme - liked it. cohesion of main character vs other characters throws it off a bit

Wicked: For Good - last 30 min are really good. why is the first 1 hr 45 min even there?

A House of Dynamite - quite good! loved it.

Jay Kelly - liked it. the ending is good.

Bugonia - ok

No Other Choice

If I Had Legs I'd Kick You - 

Die, My Love - 

The Testament of Ann Lee

Wake Up Dead Man - pretty good.

Eternity - good movie. goes a little off at the end.
